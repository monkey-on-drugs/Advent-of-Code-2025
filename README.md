# Advent of Code 2025

This repo contains my (or this project's) Advent of Code 2025 solutions. Each day is implemented independently and may use different languages or approaches. Solutions aim to be readable, correct, and reasonably efficient. [Try yourself](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

## About Me
I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at IIT Delhi, studying Electrical Engineering. I’m interested in algorithms, quantitative finance, and systems programming, and I use projects like this to sharpen my thinking and problem-solving skills outside coursework. Advent of Code is mostly a personal benchmark for consistency and improvement, not speedrunning or leaderboard chasing.
